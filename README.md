OR

If you would like to understand more about the code behind the app and edit it, click "<> code" - the green button. After clicking, in the local tab, copy the SSH key. Open the terminal in your Macbook or [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), if you have Windows, and type:

```bash
git clone [paste ssh key]
```

I would recommend downloading [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to edit the code locally.

A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser.
